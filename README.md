# gogofast

Practice on the command line your typing skills with snippets stored as gists.

**Requires [gotta-go-fast](https://github.com/callum-oakley/gotta-go-fast) installed**.

It will pick a random gist with the `#gogofast` tag in the description.

It receives `username` as a single argument:

```
npx gogofast MauricioRobayo
```

**Tip:** Create an alias on your `.bashrc` file (or your preferred shell):

```
alias ggf='npx --quiet gogofast MauricioRobayo'
```

Use it as `ggf` and profit.
